Assignment 3
Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 


Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
 
Expected Output:
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:
Enter a number: 5 
Factorial of 5 is : 120


Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.

Expected Output:
 For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
 Enter a number: 5
 Square root: 5.0
 Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
 Sine: -0.13235175009777303
